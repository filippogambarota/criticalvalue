  abstract = {Interpretation of regression coefficients is sensitive to the
  scale of the inputs. One method often used to place input variables on a
  common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation.
  Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard
  deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean
  +/-1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly
  comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the
  procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple
  analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data
  from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data
  on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our
  rescaling as a default option--an improvement upon the usual approach of
  including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file--so that
  the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine
  statistical practice.},

  divided by the sample standard deviation, is studied in the context of an
  explicit statistical model. The exact distribution of Glass's estimator is
  obtained and the estimator is shown to have a small sample bias. The minimum
  variance unbiased estimator is obtained and shown to have uniformly smaller
  variance than Glass's (biased) estimator. Measurement error is shown to
  attenuate estimates of effect size and a correction is given. The effects of
  measurement invalidity are discussed. Expressions for weights that yield the
  most precise weighted estimate of effect size are also derived.},

	abstract = {The idea that in behavioral research everything correlates with everything else was a niche area of the scientific literature for more than half a century. With the increasing availability of large data sets in psychology, the “crud” factor has, however, become more relevant than ever before. When referenced in empirical work, it is often used by researchers to discount minute—but statistically significant—effects that are deemed too small to be considered meaningful. This review tracks the history of the crud factor and examines how its use in the psychological- and behavioral-science literature has developed to this day. We highlight a common and deep-seated lack of understanding about what the crud factor is and discuss whether it can be proven to exist or estimated and how it should be interpreted. This lack of understanding makes the crud factor a convenient tool for psychologists to use to disregard unwanted results, even though the presence of a crud factor should be a large inconvenience for the discipline. To inspire a concerted effort to take the crud factor more seriously, we clarify the definitions of important concepts, highlight current pitfalls, and pose questions that need to be addressed to ultimately improve understanding of the crud factor. Such work will be necessary to develop the crud factor into a useful concept encouraging improved psychological research.},
